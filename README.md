# Helldivers 2 Guide Website, Spring 2024
This project was developed as part of my *Introduction to Web Technologies* course. The goal was to apply foundational web development techniques to build a client-side website, focusing on design, layout, and interactivity using modern web standards and tools.
## Project Overview
This website provides a fan-made guide for video game *Helldivers 2*, showcasing essential gameplay information and resources using:
* HTML: Structures the content and layout of the site.
* CSS: Styles and formats the site for a clean and responsive design.
* JavaScript: Adds interactivity and functionality to enhance user experience.
* Digital Assets: Implements optimized images and file formats suitable for the web.
* UNIX & Networking Basics: Understood and applied as part of the broader web development workflow.
## Testing
The website was manually tested across different browsers and screen sizes to ensure visual consistency and responsiveness. More qork can be done in the future to account for more screen sizes.
## Notes
* This project was designed for educational purposes.
* The design and content reflect a personal interest in Helldivers 2, making it both a technical and creative exercise.
* No backend or server-side components were included, as the course focused on client-side technologies.
