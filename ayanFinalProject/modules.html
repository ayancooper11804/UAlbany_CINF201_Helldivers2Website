      <h2>Ship Modules</h2>
      <p class="summary">
        At higher difficulties, it can become harder to survive to the point where not even
        Stratagems are guarenteed to save players. However, Stratagems can be improved through
        upgrades of the Ship Module. These upgrades affect various traits of Stratagems, such as
        reducing Stratagem cooldown time, increasing damage, maximizing ammo, and more. These upgrades
        can only be purchased via the samples players collect in missions, so players are advised
        to collect and extract with as many samples as possible.

        <h2>Upgrades to Prioritize</h2>
        <p>
          There are tons of Ship Module upgrades to purchase, so there are a few players recommend
          to prioritze right away to help have a better experience. Players recommend uprgading the
          Patriotic Administration Center, Orbital Cannons, and Hangar categories to the first level.
          This ensures Support Weapons are deployed wth max ammo, Orbital Stratagems do extra damage,
          and Eagle Stratagems have a reduced cooldown time respectively.
