      <h2>Armor</h2>
      <p class="summary">
        Players can equip various armor to enhance their gameplay. Armor comes with stats
        known as Armor Rating, Speed, and Stamina Regen. Thes stats affect
        how much damage players take, their movement speed, and how fast players regain their stamina
        respectively. Armor also comes with a Passive Ability, which is something extra that can further improve
        players' stats and items in game. Such abilities include increasing Stim capacity (an item that allows
        players to heal from damage), increasing grenade capacity, making players less visible to enemies,
        reduce damage taken, and more.
